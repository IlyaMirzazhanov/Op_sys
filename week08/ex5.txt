Physical address - adress of a real data slot in hardware memory(means, the physical memory)

Virtual address - a pointer to an area of memory that the OS gives the process to work with.

Virtual memory is usually larger than physical memory. Sometimes VA and PA differ, so VA is dynamically mapped to PA in RAM.
