Virtual address - a pointer to an area of memory, OS allows the process to work with it.
Physical address - adress of a real data slot in hardware memory(means, the physical memory)
Virtual memory is usually bigger than physical memory. Sometimes VA and PA differ, means VA is dynamically mapped to PA in RAM.
